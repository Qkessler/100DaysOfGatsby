These are some of the notes that I realized today when learning a bit more about
routing and queries in general. A very cool feature about react, and more concise,
gatsby react components, is that we get to use "useStaticQuery", which takes the
query as argument.
#+begin_src js
  const locationData = useStaticQuery(graphql`query {
    contentfulLocation(name: {eq: "Cartagena"}, location: {lat: {}, lon: {}}, createdAt: {}) {
      id
      name
      description {
        content {
          content {
            value
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
    `)
 console.log(locationData)
#+end_src

This would allow us to pass the queried data to a constant, in order to use it below,
a react html block for example.

One of the biggest differences between page queries and staticQueries, hence the name,
is that we cannot pass variables or arguments to the latter, as they are meant to be
reusable components, not dependent on the passed arguments. Nevertheless, it is amazing
to see the staticQuery functionality implemented, makes the code a ton more readable.
