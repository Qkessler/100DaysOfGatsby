#+roam_tags: programming jsx react components html css

Gatsby is built on React. This means, and I'm not really well versed with it
that we will use components instead of making use of the default browser style
html tags.

Gatsby uses JSX, which is a format that merges together the use of javaScript,
html and css in the same file!. When we are trying to reuse information, which
we could abstract to html tags, we create components:

#+begin_src js
  const Header => () {
    const headerText = props.headerText
    return (
      <h1>{headerText}</h1>
    )
  }

export default Header
#+end_src

Let's imagine we have placed the header.js file under /components/header.js.  On
our file, let's say index.js we can import the Header component using relative
imports.

#+begin_src js
  import Header from "../component/header.js"
  //...
  export default function About() {
    return (
       <div style={{ color: `teal` }}>
      <Header headerText="About Gatsby" />
      <p>Such wow. Very React.</p>
    </div>
  )
}
#+end_src

This headerText is passed as arguments inside the props dictionary, which
contains the argument (in this case attribute) passed as headerText, which we
access using props.headerText.
